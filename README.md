**ShopSync** is an AI-driven inventory and logistics optimization platform for small and medium businesses (SMBs), integrated with **IMS-Invoice-services**, a mobile-first invoicing app for shopkeepers. Powered by a custom **distributed task scheduler**, **Edge AI**, and **Cloud GNN**, ShopSync enables shopkeepers to manage sales, inventory, and suppliers efficiently while optimizing restocking and logistics with real-time insights.

This project is developed as part of an MCA final-year project, targeting Indian retail SMBs ($20B+ market). It showcases advanced system design, machine learning, and distributed computing, with applications in retail logistics, crowdsourced data, and supplier optimization.

## üìñ Introduction

ShopSync empowers shopkeepers with a seamless solution for daily operations and strategic decision-making:
- **IMS-Invoice-services**: A React Native/Next.js app for sales tracking, GST-compliant invoicing, inventory management, and supplier tracking.
- **ShopSync Core**: An AI-driven suite using **Edge AI** (TensorFlow Lite) for demand forecasting, **Cloud GNN** (PyTorch) for supplier recommendations, and a **Spring Boot-based distributed task scheduler** for logistics optimization.
- **Key Scenarios**:
  - Real-time supplier selection (e.g., ‚ÄúOrder from Anil Traders, 2 hours‚Äù).
  - Crowdsourced supplier database (e.g., ‚Äú100 shopkeepers trust Anil Traders‚Äù).
  - Shopkeeper-as-supplier order optimization (e.g., ‚ÄúCombine Suresh‚Äôs order, save 30 minutes‚Äù).
  - Deduplication of supplier data for accuracy.

Built for non-tech-savvy shopkeepers, ShopSync offers a simple UI (Hindi support), offline capabilities, and scalability for thousands of users. The project demonstrates enterprise-grade system design (Kubernetes, Kafka, GNN) and shows scalable startup potential in the Indian retail market.
